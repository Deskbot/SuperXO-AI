	 * The usefulness of each cell depends on how easily filling it in will cause the grid to be won
	 * multiplying every cell worth in a winning trio shows the liklihood of it happening
	 * we can't just take an average of all products because:
	 * XX_
	 * __X
	 * __X
	 * counts 4 that are 1 away, even though only 2 cells cause the grid to be 1 away
	 * we need to assume because it's a cutoff heuristic that we are choosing a random cell
	 * so we need to know the liklihood that choosing a cell will cause a win, going in TR above is only worth 1 win
	 * solution:
	 * for each cell find the highest chance of winning assuming you have that cell, then multiply it by that cell's own liklihood
	 * average those chances as all cells are assumed to be equally likley to be chosen
