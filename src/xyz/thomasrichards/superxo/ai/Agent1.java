/*
 * This agent uses the weighting of each trio of ways of winning as a heuristic
 * to determine how good the current game state is for a given player
 *
 * tactic:
 * we have a fraction (between 0 and 1 inclusive) for each cell in a grid
 * the number represents its worth i.e. how close to owning the player is.
 * The usefulness of each cell depends on how easily filling it in will cause the grid to be won
 * multiplying every cell worth in a winning trio shows the liklihood of it happening
 * we can't just take an average of all products because:
 * XX_
 * __X
 * __X
 * counts 4 that are 1 away, even though only 2 cells cause the grid to be 1 away
 * we need to assume because it's a cutoff heuristic that we are choosing a random cell
 * so we need to know the liklihood that choosing a cell will cause a win, going in TR above is only worth 1 win
 * solution:
 * for each cell find the highest chance of winning involving that that cell, then multiply it by that cell's own liklihood
 * average those chances as all cells are assumed to be equally likley to be chosen
